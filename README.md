# password
password creator and brute forcer



- Let `l_min` and `l_max` be the minimum and maximum password lengths.
(`l_min` <= `l_max`)
- In the following, `PCS` (password character set) will be the set of all characters used to compose the password. (In the following,
`PCS` is defined as a real subset of the ASCII set, since `ASCII` can be used internationally without any problems.
Elements of the `UTF-8` code may not be supported on some websites. However, any other characters can be added to or excluded from the set.)
